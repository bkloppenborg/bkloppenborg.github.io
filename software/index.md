### [SIMTOI](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/simtoi)

The SImulation and Modeling Tool for Optical Interferometry is a fast, 
GPU-enabled geometric model fitting program for optical interferometric data. 
The program supports a variety of models that are rendered in a 3D, fully 
time-dependent environment.  This code is open source (GPL v3) and distributed 
on GitHub.

### [LIBOI](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/liboi)

The OpenCL Interferometry Library (liboi) implements several commonly needed 
routines in optical interferometry in the a heterogeneous computing environment 
using OpenCL.  This library serves as the backend for SIMTOI and GPAIR.  This 
code is open source (LGPL) and distributed on GitHub.

### [SpectraCyber Control Software](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/spectra-cyber)

Control software for 
[Radio Astronomy Supplies 1420 MHz hydrogen line spectrometer](http://www.radioastronomysupplies.com/show_detail.php?item_id=4) 
which I wrote as part of my computer science senior project in undergraduate. 
The code is in C# and interfaces with the SpectraCyber via. an RS-232 (serial) 
connection.  Data collected is stored in a MS Access database.  This code is 
open source (GPL v3) and distributed on GitHub.  I do not intend to develop 
this code any further so please contact me if you are interested in becoming 
the maintainer of the package.
