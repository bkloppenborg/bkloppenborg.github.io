In 2002 a friend and I attempted to start a wireless Internet service provider,
called "Hastings Wireless" in our home town of Hastings, NE. Our objective was
to blanket public spaces with WiFi which the public could use at some minimal
cost. The project ran for about 1.5 years and collected a small, 5-person
following, but didn't acheive critical mass and ultimately closed on 2009-08-16.

In the interest of preserving this (failed) activity, I've resurrected most of
the content from our website and posted it to this blog with the original article

## Restrospective

Hastings Wireless was a good idea at the right time, but it failed to 
garner widespread attention and ultimately failed. 

The problem wasn't technological in nature: there was widespread support for 
802.11 technology by laptops and PDAs owned by consumers in the area, 3G wireless 
technology wasn't generally avaliable (in Nebraska) at the time, EDGE was too 
slow/expensive to use, and 2.4 GHz wifi devices were inexpensive and widespread.
Likewise, there were many other similar projects (
[Seattle Wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Wireless),
being the most famous and long-running) which were successful.

I think the reasons why it failed were as follows:

1. Lack of capital: The founders were young and worked minimum wage ($4.25/hr) jobs.
2. Lack of advertising: We had no budget; mass media was expensive; and there
   was not a suitable group (like a Linux Users Group) to which we could present 
   the idea, get feedback, and garner attention.
3. A lack of political and logistical expertise: Municipal zoning, FCC regulations,
   and FAA limitations completely eliminated operation at one of our sites
   which had good public visibility.

All-in-all, it was a fun project which, despite its failure, had minimial
long-term impact. It also spawned our interest in (computer) networking
technology which helped launch one of our careers in the tech sector.
