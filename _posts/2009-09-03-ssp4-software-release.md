Recently I received an inquiry about some software I wrote for my undergraduate
senior project. In the interest of the community, I have released my control
software for Optec's SSP-4 photometer as open source code.

The software is written in C# and is already compatible with Linux and Mac
(both running under Mono). Output data is stored in a formatted text file.
The release build of this program can be downloaded ~~from my portfolio
page.~~ from my [SSP-4 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/ssp4-control-software)
