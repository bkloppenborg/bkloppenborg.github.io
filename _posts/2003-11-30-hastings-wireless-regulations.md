## Introduction

In Business, everything is location, location, location. It seems to be the same
when it comes to setting up a long-distance backbone. Due the airport behind
Node 1, many zoning, FAA, and FCC regulations apply that are not otherwise
applicable in other areas of town. We visited with the city engineers and zoning
professionals to determine how much these regulations will limit our activities.

## Details

The first regulation we ran across dealt with height limitations. In Hastings,
Nebraska no structure may exceed 25 percent of the principle structure. We had
originally planned to put a tower up in the corner of Node 1's lot, but it seems
the airport wouldn't be too pleased with that notion. Given that the principle
structure located at Node 1 is a single story Ranch Style house with a maximum
height of about 18 feet, we could only build a tower that would be 22.5 feet
tall. We were hoping for something more like 30 feet so that we could clear a
majority of the structures between Node 1 and Node 2.

I visited with the city engineer about the height restriction. He gave me one
heck of a loophole. He stated that if, when he came out to do his survey, the
principle structure was taller than normal, he could grant a higher height
restriction. I asked him a hypothetical question that went something like this:

> So if the house had an antenna mount that extended five feet above the roof
> line, would that be part of the principle structure?" 

After thinking about it for a few seconds (and conferring with the local zoning
guru) he concluded that the antenna mount would be part of the principle
structure. Then I asked another hypothetical question: 

> So, if the house had, say a 20 foot telescoping antenna mount on it when you
> did your inspection, would the principle structure be 20 foot taller?

He smiled when he realized what I was going to do. He said, "What I see when I
do my inspection is all I see." He did warn me not to exceed the 35 foot height
limitation placed on all residential districts in Hastings though.

Okay, that was _awesome_! I have basically been granted to put a pole atop my
house so I can be granted the proper height clearance for my tower! But what
about the airport? Unfortunately, the FAA has height restrictions as well since
Node 1 is located on the side of an approach way. What is even worse is that
these height restrictions are more stringent than those placed by the City of
Hastings. After reviewing the application and time span for approval, I decided
not to install a tower in my backyard however, I have included my design plans
for reference for others who wish to install their own tower.

## Conclusion

Regulations stink.
