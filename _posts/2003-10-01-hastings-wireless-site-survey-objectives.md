It is now our new objective to determine if there are any networks within
the vicinity of or between Node 1 or Node 2 that might interfere with our 
long-distance (2 km) link.

To accomplish this task, we will conduct a site survey of the areas in
question. During this activity, we will log basic information about a given
access point (approximate location, channel, SSID, encryption usage, and 
signal strength). In the event that we discover unsecured access points 
we will attempt to identify the owner/operator and advise them of proper
security protocols.
