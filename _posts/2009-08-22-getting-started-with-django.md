## Getting Started

If you have not worked with Django before, I strongly suggest you work through
the tutorial
[tutorial](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/#intro-tutorial01)
in which you build a simple user poll application. There is also a nice
[e-book](http://djangobook.com/) about Django once you get into the project a
little more. The documentation for Django can be found
[online](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/) and I suspect you can also find
it using Python's built-in documentation feature. Keep an eye out for my
additional Django-related posts.

Note: since I originally posted these articles several of my clients started
asking for functionality I did not have time to implement. I transitioned
their websites over to Joomla and took my personal website with it to gain
additional experience with the CMS. I still think Django is a superior
platform for developers like me, but without sufficient time to dedicate to the
development, I had to resort to something pre-built.
