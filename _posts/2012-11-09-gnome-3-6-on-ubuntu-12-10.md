When I first migrated from Gnome 2.6 to the 3.x branch I hated it. I
even started running Unity in fallback mode just so I could get work
done. I was not alone in this opinion. Indeed, the [controversy over Gnome3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy_over_GNOME_3) even 
has its own Wikipedia page! Eventually I read up on some of the new features added to Gnome 3 and gave the new UI a fair chance.

The new interface is, shall we say, minimal. Gone is the traditional
gnome menu. Instead it is replaced with a fancy animated _things_.
Because I didn't like what I was seeing I quickly started customizing.
Through the use of `gnome-tweak-tool` and extensions, I have a desktop
that makes me more productive and (slightly) more happy.

Many of the changes I suggest below require the use of the 
`gnome-tweak-tool` which you can install via:

    sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool

## Static number of workspaces

I organize my desktops in a very specific way. Desktop 1 is for my
primary task. Desktop 2 is for reference material. Desktop 3 is for
instant messaging and overflow content from the first two desktops and
finally my fourth desktop is for email and music. Gnome 3 broke this
 workflow horribly. Instead of having a static number of workspaces, I
had a dynamically changing number. If I closed all of the windows on
desktop 2, desktop 2 would disappear. No longer were things arranged
the way I wanted.

Fortunately, there were extensions for Gnome 3.4 
([Frippery bottom panel](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3/bottom-panel/) or [Workspace Grid](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/484/workspace-grid/)) that fixed this. In Gnome 3.6, you can
specify a static number of desktops through the `gnome-tweak-tool`.
Simply open up the program and navigate to the `Shell` group. From
there, shut off dynamic workspaces and set the number of desktops you
want to have. Note, the arrangement is vertical by default. If you want
some other arrangement, you need to install [Workspace Grid](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/484/workspace-grid/).

## Show the date on the clock

My schedule is routine enough that I know the day of the week, but I
seldom know the date. The clock in Gnome 3 normally shows the time (in
24-hour format). You can click on the clock and change the time format
to 12-hour through the `Date and Time Settings`, but there is no way to
change the clock format. 

In the `Shell` section of `gnome-tweak-tool` there is a simple toggle
to add the date to the clock. Simply activate the "Show the date in
clock" toggle.

## Battery icon missing

Although not strictly a Gnome 3x problem, this one annoyed me
endlessly.  If you install Gnome 3x on top of a system running Unity,
the battery icon might appear on the login screen, but disappear once
you login. The batter icon is not missing, in fact is is there:

![The battery icon in Gnome 3 is dark if you have previously used Unity](/images/blog/2012-12-09-gnome-3-battery-icon-missing.png)

To fix this open up `gnome-tweak-tool` and navigate to the "Theme" on
the left pane.  Choose a different icon theme. Some will show the
battery icon, others will not. If you like the default Ubuntu theme,
the `LoginIcons` theme matches the default `Ubuntu-mono-dark`.

## Extensions, extensions, extensions

Perhaps my favorite feature of Gnome 3 is the ability to modify the UI
using extensions. You can change simple things (like removing the
accessibility icon) or even change the way window switching works. I 
would write a few extensions to solve my remaining complaints about 
Gnome 3 (see below), but I haven't been able to find documentation on
how to write extensions! 

Anyway, here are a few of my favorite extensions:

### [Battery Power Statistics Shortcut](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/175/battery-power-statistics-shortcut/) 

Adds a shortcut to the battery menu which gives you quick access to power statics.

### [Frippery Panel Favorites](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4/panel-favorites/) 

Adds programs in your favorites to a dock in the panel. This effectively creates constantly visible launch icons.

### [Media Player Indicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/) 

Integrates media player information into the Gnome volume applet:

### [Remove Accessibility](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/112/remove-accesibility/) 

Removes the accessibility icon from the panel.

### [Status Area Horizontal Spacing](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/355/status-area-horizontal-spacing/) 

Reduces the space between applet icons in the panel.

## A few requests:

After adding these extensions I'm quite happy with how Gnome3 
functions. There are still a few requests for things I would like
to see:

1. An easy way to configure animation transition times. In Gnome 3.4
I could use the [Impatience](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/277/impatience/) extension; however, it has yet to be updated
for Gnome 3.6. Until this happens I'm just stuck waiting for the
filly animations to get out of the way.

2. A better way of switching between applications. Yes, I know I can
`ALT-TAB` between applications, but I find it faster to just click
on buttons in a system tray.

3. Documentation on shell extensions. Right now if I Google "write a gnome shell extension" the number one result is "Re: Is there a
 tutorial for writing gnome-shell-extensions?" (Edit: within a week 
or so the third hit is [step by step to write a gnome-shell extension](http://www.slideshare.net/yurenju/step-by-step-to-write-a-gnomeshell-extension), although even this nice presentation ends with a "No document sad..." statement).
