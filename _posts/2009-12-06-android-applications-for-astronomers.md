The QRCodes on the right hand side of each entry can be scanned with the Barcode
Scanner for Andriod to make installation easier. If anyone has additional
suggestions, please let me know.

Google Sky Map For the new astronomer and old,Google Sky Map is a handy
application. It uses your phone's GPS to identify your location, and the level
and accelerometer to detect where your phone is looking. It is useful for
learning the sky for the first time, or finding and identifying obscure objects.
Search for "Sky Map" in the Andriod Market.

CSDroid If you are like me and you travel to far-off obs_ervatories, and you
want to know Clear Sky Clock's predictions for your location, this application
is for you. Using your phone's GPS, the program queries for nearby observatories
that have clear sky clock entries and provides them in a convenient list. You
can flag specific Clear Sky clocks as "favourites" and have access to them
faster. A single click on one of the charts lets you bring up the full graphic
fromcleardarksky.com. The project ishosted on Google Code and there is
adiscussion group on Google Groups. Search for "CSDroid" in the Andriod Market

Iridium Flares If you like to look for satellites, or just want to see a -1 mag
object come and go in the sky, Iridium Flares is your application. Given either
a location you specify or the location provided by your phone's GPS, this
program determines the location and maximum brightness of upcoming iridium
flares. If you don't want to move from your favourite observing site, the
program also gives you the altitude, azimuth, and projected intensity of the
flare at your location.
