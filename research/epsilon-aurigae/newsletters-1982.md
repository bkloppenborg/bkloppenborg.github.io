Here is a list of all epsilon Aurigae campaign newsletters, including those from the 1983 and 2009 eclipses, in chronological order. I also provide a brief summary of each newsletter.

## [1982-1984 #1](files/newsletter_1982_01.pdf)

**Issue:** Jan 1982

**Summary:** Brief summary of the expectations for the 1982-1984 eclipse,
campaign announcement, and sign up form.

## [1982-1984 #2](files/newsletter_1982_02.pdf)

**Issue:** March 1982

**Summary:** Reports on the first photometric observations showed a dip of 0.1
magnitude in advance of the eclipse that turned out to be the out-of-eclipse
variations. Spectroscopic observations at UV, optical, and infrared wavelengths
are discussed. A concrete proposal for eps Aur photometric observations is
established.

## [1982-1984 #3](files/newsletter_1982_03.pdf)

**Issue:** June 1982

**Summary:** Photometric observations from Villanova U. and other PEP observers
are coming in. The recent campaign request for additional photometric observations
at the LAPP symposium at Big Bear were successful and many new PEP observers
have signed on. Additional spectroscopic data have been obtained that show
a correlation between the out-of-eclipse variations and changes seen in the
UV continuum. A series of UV spectra using IUE have been scheduled for the
summer/fall 1982. A detailed report summarizing the eps Aur system by James
R. Webb was included in this issue.

## [1982-1984 #4](files/newsletter_1982_04.pdf)

**Issue:** October 1982

**Summary:** The IAU Commission 42 (Close Binary Stars) has voted this series
of eps Aur campaign newsletters to be the official newsletter for coordination
of observing efforts. Three separate observatories (West College Observatory, 
Hopkins Phoenix Observatory, and the Mount Laguna Observatory) are now reporting
PEP observations. Photometry on the 1982 eclipse of a related eclipseing
system, 31 Cygni, are reported. Tom Ake discusses IUE observations of eps Aur.
Several photometric reports were submitted from U. Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
Georgia College Observatory, Lines Observatory, and the Hopkins Pheonix 
observatory.

NOTE: This and subsequent issues of the newsletter have been passed through an 
optical character recognition engine thus it should be searchable.

## [1982-1984 #5](files/newsletter_1982_05.pdf)

**Issue:** December 1982

**Summary:** Russel Genet has received a modest grant from the AAS to support
continued publication of this newsletter. Robert Stencel has compiled a light
curve from the IUE star tracker which agrees with other observers indicating
that the eclipse has started. John Percy requests that observers obtain a
photometric estimate every week or so to better characterize the out-of-eclipse
variations. Robert Stencel provides a short report on the ongoing IUE observations.
Dr. Parthasarathy's spectroscopy shows that neutral potassium increased
substantially during ingress. Some discussion concerning the photometry and
spectroscopy of the 31 Cyg eclipse is presented.

## [1982-1984 #6](files/newsletter_1982_06.pdf)

**Issue:** Feburary 1983

**Summary:** Eclipse totality has begun. Gary Henson and others report in
IAU circular No. 3759 that a sudden change in polarization of eps Aur between
1982 Nov. 24 and Dec. 9 has been detected. Jack Kemp has written a detailed
summary of these observations for this newsletter. Several other IAU circulars are 
presented. A request for photometric obsrvations of 32 Cyg and Zet Aur has
been presented. The IUE star tracker phtoometry estimate has been updated.
Several photometric reports are presented. Spectroscopic observations in the
infrared have revealed a source of ~600 K, suggesting a cool object with a
well organized core may be causing the eclipse.

## [1982-1984 #7](files/newsletter_1982_07.pdf)

**Issue:** May 1983

**Summary:** The eclipse continues to progress on schedule. Photometric
observation reports for eps Aur, zet Aur, and 31 Cyg continue to amass. Additional
observing time on IUE has been allocated for the eps Aur campaign. Polarimetry
observations have continued as well as several spectroscopic observing campaigns.

## [1982-1984 #8](files/newsletter_1982_08.pdf)

**Issue:** November 1983

**Summary:** This (significantly larger) report includes summaries of the
campaign efforts, an announcement of flare activity in eps Aur, and a large
repository of photometric data. Another polarimetry report from James Kemp et al.
has been submitted discussing their interpretation of the eclipse.

Note: This issue has not been digitized and is not in machine-searchable
format.
