Epsilon Aurigae (eps Aur hereafter) is a single line spectroscopic eclipsing
binary star system on which I did my Ph.D. dissertation research. The system
is thought to be composed of an F-type supergiant and a B-type companion
surrounded by a disk of opaque material of unknown composition.

Although this system is bright (V = 3.0) and has been known since antiquity,
it did not receive much attention until it was discovered to have dimmed
by nearly 50% in 1821. Since then, photometric and spectroscopic monitoring
have revealed that the system is a eclipsing binary with a 27.1 year orbit.
The system is classified as SB1 (single line spectroscopic binary) because
only one of stars in the system is detectable.

In 1912 Henry Norris Russel published the first analytic methods for binary
star analysis and applied it to epsilon Aurigae.
The result was quite interesting: the system **should** be composed of two nearly
equal mass stars, but yet only one was visible.
Several theories were proposed to explain this perplexing result, but it was
not until 1965 that Su-Shu Huang proposed that the other star may not be
visible because it was surrounded by a disk of opaque material.

During the 1983 and 2009 eclipses observation campaigns were organized and data
collected. Many of the results are summarized in subsequent publications which
can be found on [ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/). In particular, the 1985 eclipse
has [conference proceedings](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985eea..book.....S).
The 2009 eclipse has a [special edition of the JAAVSO](http://www.aavso.org/citizen-sky-epsilon-aurigae-papers).

The 2009-2011 eclipse also featured a website which was operated by Jeffrey
Hopkins until late 2012 when he transfered the contents to me. The content
of this directory largely originates from the original campaign website with
some modifications and updates as needed.
